# Text-to-video generation  ðŸŽ¥



Learning has always been a vital part of every individual's life. Sometimes it may so happen that we fall short of resources to learn and explore about certain topics or concepts . Stable Diffusion is a deep learning architecture that focuses on gradually transforming random noise into coherent data, such as images or videos, through a series of diffusion steps producing highly realistic data. We will be using this neural network to produce different educational content on animal kingdom to make the learning easier and engaging .
